Program is a sequence of instruction along with data.",
            "The basic components of a computer are:",
            "The CPU is further divided into three parts-",
            "Most of us have heard that CPU is called the brain of our computer because it accepts data, provides temporary memory space to it until it is stored(saved) on the hard disk, performs logical operations on it and hence processes(here also means converts) data into information. We all know that a computer consists of hardware and software. Software is a set of programs that performs multiple tasks together. An operating system is also software (system software) that helps humans to interact with the computer system.A program is a set of instructions given to a computer to perform a specific operation. or computer is a computational device that is used to process the data under the control of a computer program. While executing the program, raw data is processed into the desired output format. These computer programs are written in a programming language which are high-level languages. High level languages are nearly human languages that are more complex than the computer understandable language which are called machine language, or low level language. So after knowing the basics, we are ready to create a very simple and basic program. Like we have different languages to communicate with each other, likewise, we have different languages like C, C++, C#, Java, python, etc to communicate with the computers. The computer only understands binary language (the language of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s) also called machine-understandable language or low-level language but the programs we are going to write are in a high-level language which is almost similar to human language.The piece of code given below performs a basic task of printing \u201chello world! I am learning programming\u201d on the console screen. We must know that keyboard, scanner, mouse, microphone, etc are various examples of input devices, and monitor(console screen), printer, speaker, etc are examples of output devices.",
            "At this stage, you might not be able to understand in-depth how this code prints something on the screen. The main() is a standard function that you will always include in any program that you are going to create from now onwards. Note that the execution of the program starts from the main() function. The clrscr() function is used to see only the current output on the screen while the printf() function helps us to print the desired output on the screen. Also, getch() is a function that accepts any character input from the keyboard. In simple words, we need to press any key to continue(some people may say that getch() helps in holding the screen to see the output).Between high-level language and machine language, there are assembly languages also called symbolic machine code. Assembly languages are particularly computer architecture specific. Utility program (Assembler) is used to convert assembly code into executable machine code. High Level Programming Language is portable but requires Interpretation or compiling to convert it into a machine language that is computer understood.Hierarchy of Computer language \u2013",

            "LLD, or Low-Level Design, is a phase in the software development process where detailed system components and their interactions are specified. It involves converting the high-level design into a more detailed blueprint, addressing specific algorithms, data structures, and interfaces. LLD serves as a guide for developers during coding, ensuring the accurate and efficient implementation of the system\u2019s functionality. LLD describes class diagrams with the help of methods and relations between classes and program specs.",
            "Remember:Low-level designing is also known asobject-level designingormicro-levelordetailed designing.",
            "In this diagram we basically list out all the entities which can be part of components. Class diagrams are made as it becomes easier for developer to convert it into code.",
            "For instance:",
            "As studied,High Level Design or HLDis a general system design where we do tradeoffs between different frameworks, components, and different databases and we choose the best considering what the business needs and how the system should work, both in terms of functional and non functional aspects . Here we define the components and how these components will be communicating with one another. Hence here we are bothered with generic stuff as follows and not bothered about the code.",
            "As studied above, input for framing low-level design (LLD) is HLD. Here in LLD, we take care of how our components will look like, the structure possessed by different entities, and how different entities will have their responsibility(operations supported). For this conversion, we useUnified Modelling Language (UML) diagrams. Adding to these diagrams we useOOPS principlesandSOLID principleswhile designing. Hence, using these 3 paradigm we can convert any HLD to LLD so as to get implemented.",
            "In order to bridge concepts of LLD with real code let us In order to understand how to design any low-level diagram let us understand via the steps:",
            "The user requirement is processed by using concepts of OOPS programming. Hence it is recommended to have a strong grip on OOPS concepts prior to moving ahead in designing any low-level system. \u00a0Object-oriented programming concept 4 pillars are must-have to go start learning low-level designing and the programmer should be very well versed with these 4 pillars namely as follows:",
            "Within polymorphism, we should be clear-cut with compile-time and run-time polymorphism. Programmers should be absolutely clear about the OOPS concepts to depth right to classes, and objects because OOPS is the foundation on which low-leveling on any system is based.\u00a0Acing low-level design is \u2018extremely subjective\u2019 because we have to optimally use these concepts while coding to build a low-level system via implementing coding software entities(classes, functions, modules, etc)",
            "It is a analyzing phase which is our 1st step where we are claying real-world problems into object-world problems using OOPS concepts and SOLID principles.",
            "Now the implementation of our above object oriented problem is carried out with the help of design patterns. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems encountered in software design. They provide a structured approach to design by capturing best practices and proven solutions, making it easier to develop scalable, maintainable, and efficient software. Design patterns help streamline the development process, promote code reuse, and enhance the overall quality of software systems.",
            "Each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over multiple times in the environment, and their solutions can be applied repeatedly without redundancy.",
            "Why there is a need for design patterns?",
            "These problems have occurred over and over again corresponding to which these solutions have been laid out. These problems are been faced and solved by expert designers in the world of programming and the solutions are robust over time saving a lot of time and energy. Hence the complex and classic problems in the software world are being solved by tried and tested solutions.",

            "In order to write scalable, flexible, maintainable, and reusable code:",
            "It\u2019s important to keep in mind that SOLID principles are just guidelines and not strict rules to be followed. The key is to strike a balance between adhering to these principles and considering the specific needs and constraints of your business requirement."

            "The Singleton method or Singleton Design pattern is one of the simplest design patterns. It ensures a class only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.",
            "Prototype allows us to hide the complexity of making new instances from the client.\u00a0The concept is to copy an existing object rather than creating a new instance from scratch, something that may include costly operations. The existing object acts as a prototype and contains the state of the object.",
            "Builder pattern aims to \u201cSeparate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.\u201d It is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object.",

            "The bridge pattern allows the Abstraction and the Implementation to be developed independently and the client code can access only the Abstraction part without being concerned about the Implementation part.",
            "Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to \u201ccompose\u201d objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.",
            "It allows us to dynamically add functionality and behavior to an object without affecting the behavior of other existing objects within the same class.\u00a0We use inheritance to extend the behavior of the class. This takes place at compile-time, and all the instances of that class get the extended behavior.",

It is one of the Gang of Four (GoF) design patterns, which are widely used in object-oriented programming. The Strategy pattern is based on the idea of encapsulating a family of algorithms into separate classes that implement a common interface.",
